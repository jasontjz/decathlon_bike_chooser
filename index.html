          Cycling is one of the best ways to get around in Singapore - not only
          are you in control of your own timing, you get a good workout too! As
          more and more park connectors and bike lanes are built, there will be
          less reasons not to cycle as a form of transportation!<br />
          <br />
          Our collection of city bikes are inspired by Dutch-style bikes that
          are both elegant yet functional. At Decathlon, our product designers
          and managers are cyclists too! This is why you will find many
          practical and well-thought features on our city bikes. The
          step-through steel frame is sturdy and will last you through many
          years of service. We have even made sure to integrate a rear rack on
          every city bike - after all, grocery shopping and hauling light goods
          will most probably be one of its main tasks!<br />

          If you can't decide whether you will spend more time riding on the
          road and PCNs or if you might want to go somewhere a little more
          rugged, instead of choosing between a road bike or a mountain bike,
          why not choose a Hybrid bike?<br />
          <br />
          A hybrid bike is a mix between a road bike, mountain bike and even a
          city bike. The frame is designed for the rider to sit upright like on
          a city bike and not as aggressive as a road or even mountain bike. The
          tyres are wider and knobbier than a road bike for more ruggedness, yet
          skinnier and smoother than a mountain bike for better rolling speed on
          the roads. On some models, the bike is equipped with a suspension fork
          to smooth out bumps, yet does not bounce as much as on a mountain bike
          in order to achieve the perfect balance between comfort and
          efficiency. And while it is not equipped with a rack by default like
          on a city bike, the frame has the correct mounting points and
          Decathlon Singapore offers a wide choice of racks to choose from
          (available to purchase separately). It is truly a hybrid in all senses
          of the word, offering you the best of all the cycling worlds!<br />

          As the sport of road cycling has grown exponentially in the past few
          decades, so too have different riding styles emerged and become more
          distinct. At Decathlon, we recognize this divergence and our product
          designers & managers have therefore heeded the call by creating two
          distinct sub-brands according to riding style - Triban and Van Rysel,
          for the endurance and racing markets respectively.<br />
          <br />
          We have a range of bikes that are suitable for all skill levels - from
          beginners to experts. We also have other road bike accessories which
          include road bike shoes. Road bike shoes are important in bringing the
          most out of your road cycling journey. It will help transmit your
          pedaling power into the bicycle. We also assure comfort and quality
          with our road bike shoes.<br />

                A simple bike means less things to go wrong! By ditching the
                complexities of more gears, hydraulic braking systems and
                advanced suspension forks you can focus on cycling instead of
                maintaining your bike.

        <p>
          Folding and foldable bikes, also affectionately known as 'foldies' are
          an extremely popular type of bicycle in Singapore owing to their
          easily stored and transportable nature. Being compact, they are also a
          popular choice among smaller riders, ladies & children!<br />
          <br />
          <br />At Decathlon Singapore, we have a range of affordable and
          wallet-friendly options for foldable bikes in Singapore.

          Looking for a bike to commute in the city? Or perhaps you just need to
          cycle to the supermarket every now and then.<br />
          <br />
          Whatever your needs, if you are looking for a bike that can get you
          from point A to B while hauling your groceries (or your kids), you've
          come to the right place!<br />
          <br />
          Our city bikes are designed for easy mounting and dismounting, as well
          as transportation of goods. All our city bikes have integrated racks,
          kickstands and fenders, making them the practical choice in any
          situation.<br />

        <p>
          Road Endurance Cycling prioritize long distances, and the bikes
          feature comfortable geometry, sturdiness and practical features like
          rack mounts.<br />
          Road endurance riders are typically riding not only to clock miles,
          but to enjoy the sights and sounds along the way.<br />
          The average pace over a 2 hour ride is usually around 20-30km/h and
          may include a stop or two.<br />
          Road endurance riders will also enjoy participating in Gran Fondos or
          Century rides in a large group, with an emphasis on finishing the ride
          as opposed to coming in first.<br />
          In other words, no stress - chill and enjoy the ride! ;)

          As such, be prepared to sacrifice comfort for speed.<br />
