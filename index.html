    <h3>Urban Cycling</h3>
    <p>Cycling is one of the best ways to get around in Singapore - not only are you in control of your own timing, you get a good workout too! As more and more park connectors and bike lanes are built, there will be less reasons not to cycle as a form of transportation!<br>
      <br>
      Durable and Well-Designed City Bikes<br>
      Our collection of city bikes are inspired by Dutch-style bikes that are both elegant yet functional. At Decathlon, our product designers and managers are cyclists too! This is why you will find many practical and well-thought features on our city bikes. The step-through steel frame is sturdy and will last you through many years of service. We have even made sure to integrate a rear rack on every city bike - after all, grocery shopping and hauling light goods will most probably be one of its main tasks!<br>

    <h3>Hybrid Cycling</h3>
    <p>If you can't decide whether you will spend more time riding on the road and PCNs or if you might want to go somewhere a little more rugged, instead of choosing between a road bike or a mountain bike, why not choose a Hybrid bike?<br>
      <br>
      What is a Hybrid Bike?<br>
      A hybrid bike as its name suggests is a mix between a road bike, mountain bike and even a city bike. The frame is designed for the rider to sit upright like on a city bike and not as aggressive as a road or even mountain bike. The tyres are wider and knobbier than a road bike for more ruggedness, yet skinnier and smoother than a mountain bike for better rolling speed on the roads. On some models, the bike is equipped with a suspension fork to smooth out bumps, yet does not bounce as much as on a mountain bike in order to achieve the perfect balance between comfort and efficiency. And while it is not equipped with a rack by default like on a city bike, the frame has the correct mounting points and Decathlon Singapore offers a wide choice of racks to choose from (available to purchase separately). It is truly a hybrid in all senses of the word, offering you the best of all the cycling worlds!<br>
      <br>
      Hybrid Bicycles for the Whole Family<br>
      We have both Adult and Kids hybrid bikes available in our range. The Adult Hybrid Bikes come in different varieties and price points, offering more features like lighter frames, suspension forks, more powerful brakes and increased gearing at different price levels. The Kids Hybrid Bikes are available in 20" and 24" wheel sizes to cater to different ages and heights, starting from 6 years old all the way up to 12.<br>

    <h3>Road Cycling</h3>
    <p>As the sport of road cycling has grown exponentially in the past few decades, so too have different riding styles emerged and become more distinct. At Decathlon, we recognize this divergence and our product designers & managers have therefore heeded the call by creating two distinct sub-brands according to riding style - Triban and Van Rysel, for the endurance and racing markets respectively.<br>
      <br>
      We have a range of bikes that are suitable for all skill levels - from beginners to experts.<br>
      <br>
      We also have other road bike accessories which include road bike shoes. Road bike shoes are important in bringing the most out of your road cycling journey. It will help transmit your pedaling power into the bicycle. We also assure comfort and quality with our road bike shoes.<br>

        Will you need to combine cycling with public transport? Or perhaps you don't have much space at home or a proper bicycle parking lot at your office. If that is the case, a folding bike could be a good choice. Otherwise, a traditional city bike would offer much more carrying capacity.

          <br>

              Road Endurance Cycling prioritize long distances, and the bikes feature comfortable geometry, sturdiness and practical features like rack mounts.<br>
              Road endurance riders are typically riding not only to clock miles, but to enjoy the sights and sounds along the way.<br>
              The average pace over a 2 hour ride is usually around 20-30km/h and may include a stop or two.<br>
              Road endurance riders will also enjoy participating in Gran Fondos or Century rides in a large group, with an emphasis on finishing the ride as opposed to coming in first.<br>
              In other words, no stress - chill and enjoy the ride! ;)

                As such, be prepared to sacrifice comfort for speed.<br>
                Worth it in the end, when you out-sprint the pack at the finish line!<br>
